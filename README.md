# Pytorch_multi_classifier

## Summary

The goal of this project is to implement a multi-label classifier using a convolutional neural network and the CIFAR dataset, not using any pre-trained models.

The baseline for comparison is the PyTorch tutorial classifier, which achieved a 54% accuracy on this task. My classifier achieved 63,1%, which is significant improvement given the model is similarily simple.

Main tools/skills used:
- Convolutional neural network in PyTorch
- Regularization methods (dropout, early stopping)
- Batch normalization
- Xavier initialization
